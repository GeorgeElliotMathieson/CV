## **Profile** <span style="float: right;"><a href="#george-mathieson"><strong style="font-size: 1.5em;">^</strong></a></span> <a id="profile"></a>

A highly driven and practical-thinking Computer Engineer with a proven track record of developing impactful, real-world optimisation solutions within Tesla. My drive to build robust, efficient software is a tangible motivator behind all of my work, including single-handedly creating a now-indispensable scheduling and routing tool for Tesla's UK Delivery operations. I am now eager to apply my deep passion for algorithm design, numerical optimisation, and machine learning to complex, system-level engineering challenges across more software and computing domains.

### **Customer Experience Specialist - Tesla Direct** | September 2024 – Present

Having co-developed the role when it was introduced to Tesla in 2024 and being involved in the success that has led it to expand to other departments since, I am proud to have handled the end-to-end customer relations for the innovative 'Tesla Direct' delivery programme. In attempt to balance the duties of this role with my personal ambitions at Tesla, I identified a critical operational inefficiency and took the initiative to develop a software solution that works seamlessly with internal systems and existing workflows.

#### **Key Achievements:** 
* Spearheaded, designed, and single-handedly developed a full-stack web application to automate and optimise the complex scheduling process for 'Tesla Direct' deliveries.
* Engineered a sophisticated optimisation algorithm that streamlines shift allocation to maximise personnel and time efficiency, significantly improving a core departmental process.
* Integrated the `Google Cloud APIs` to leverage real-time traffic data, ensuring accurate and efficient delivery-route planning.
* Augmented otherwise unavailable filtering and processing options by interpreting raw data directly from `Ziplabs` (Tesla's internal data management tool) to reliably inform scheduling recommendations.
* Successfully deployed the tool into a production environment, where it is now in daily use by all 'Lead Operations Specialists' and 'Customer Experience Specialists' across the UK and Ireland.
* Acquired the necessary support for a rollout across the EMEA region, in coordination with the US software team - demonstrating its robustness, scalability, and overall success so far.

## **Technical Projects** <span style="float: right;"><a href="#george-mathieson"><strong style="font-size: 1.5em;">^</strong></a></span> <a id="technical-projects"></a>

#### **Abstracting Control of Industrial Robots Using Machine Learning Heuristics**
* Developed a machine learning solution using `Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO)` to abstract the complex low-level programming of industrial robots, making them accessible to non-specialist operators.
* Successfully integrated the reinforcement learning algorithm with a high-fidelity digital twin of a 6-axis `FANUC LR Mate 200iC` industrial robot to simulate and validate control strategies.
* Demonstrated a self-taught model capable of precise joint positioning, enabling more efficient and intuitive high-level control and reducing the need for specialised training.

#### **Universal CAN Transceiver & Vehicle Digital Dashboard**
* Designed and developed an affordable, plug-and-play vehicle telemetry system to provide car enthusiasts with real-time `Engine Control Unit (ECU)` data, bridging the gap between expensive professional equipment and consumer accessibility.
* Engineered a full-stack solution featuring an `ESP32` microcontroller for real-time `Controller Area Network (CAN)` bus data acquisition and a `Single Board Computer (SBC)` acting as a central hub for running a `Node.js` backend, working together to stream vehicle data wirelessly via `Bluetooth` to a dynamic web-based dashboard.
* Developed a responsive, single-page web application with a highly customisable `Graphical User Interface (GUI)`, enabling users to adjust gauge layouts and visual themes from a browser.

#### **FPGA Realtime State Machine**
* Developed a user-configurable, high-precision timekeeper in `VHDL` on a `Terasic DE1-SoC` `FPGA`, creating a versatile solution for multi-lap applications with its various modes of use.
* Engineered the system using a modular `VHDL` architecture, implementing a comprehensive `Finite State Machine (FSM)` to control logic, process user inputs, and drive a multiplexed seven-segment display interface.
* Delivered a fully functional prototype that met all system specifications, demonstrating proficiency in hardware-software integration, rigorous `User Acceptance Testing (UAT)`, and critical analysis by identifying just a single runtime bug and proposing a novel switch debouncing solution.

## **Interests** <span style="float: right;"><a href="#george-mathieson"><strong style="font-size: 1.5em;">^</strong></a></span> <a id="interests"></a>

Outside of the aforementioned projects, I am a dedicated musician with over thirteen years of experience playing the trumpet and piano. Performing and composing, particularly in jazz ensembles, has honed my creative problem-solving and collaborative skills - a mindset I apply directly to my engineering work.
