A highly driven and practical-thinking Computer Engineer with a proven track record of developing impactful, real-world optimisation solutions. My drive to build robust, efficient software is a tangible motivator behind my work, including single-handedly creating a now-indispensable scheduling and routing tool for Tesla's UK Delivery operations. I am eager to apply my deep passion for algorithm design, numerical optimisation, and machine learning to complex, system-level engineering challenges across software and computing domains.

### **Customer Experience Specialist - Tesla Direct** | September 2024 â€“ Present

Having co-developed the role when it was introduced to Tesla in 2024 and being involved in the success that has led it to expand to other departments since, I am proud to have handled the end-to-end customer relations for the innovative 'Tesla Direct' delivery programme. In attempt to balance the duties of this role with my personal ambitions at Tesla, I identified a critical operational inefficiency and took the initiative to develop a software solution that works seamlessly with internal systems and existing workflows.

#### **Key Achievements:** 
* Spearheaded, designed, and single-handedly developed a full-stack web application to automate and optimise the complex scheduling process for 'Tesla Direct' deliveries.
* Engineered a sophisticated optimisation algorithm that streamlines shift allocation to maximise personnel and time efficiency, significantly improving a core departmental process.
* Integrated the `Google Cloud APIs` to leverage real-time traffic data, ensuring accurate and efficient delivery-route planning.
* Augmented otherwise unavailable filtering and processing options by interpreting raw data directly from `Ziplabs` (Tesla's internal data management tool) to reliably inform scheduling recommendations.
* Successfully deployed the tool into a production environment, where it is now in daily use by all 'Lead Operations Specialists' and 'Customer Experience Specialists' across the UK and Ireland.
